# ChAImeleon Open Challenges

The ChAImeleon Open Challenges is a competition designed to train 
and refine AI models to answer clinical questions about five types 
of cancer: prostate, lung, breast, colon, and rectal. 
Participants are challenged to collaborate and develop innovative
AI-powered solutions that can significantly impact cancer diagnosis, 
management, and treatment. 

You can find more information in the following link: https://chaimeleon.grand-challenge.org/overview/

This repository includes some example scripts to build the inference code for
the evaluation of your models in both the Validation and Test phases of the 
Classification phase using grand-challenge platform.
